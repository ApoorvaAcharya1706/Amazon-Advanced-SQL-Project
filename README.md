# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**

---

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behaviour, product performance, and sales trends using "SQL Server Management Studio". Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Learning Outcomes**

This project enabled me to:
- Design and implement a normalized database schema.
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets for analysis.
- Use advanced SQL techniques, including window function, subqueries, joins, stored procedures etc.
- Conduct in-depth business analysis using SQL.
- Optimize query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

## **Conclusion**

This advanced SQL project successfully demonstrates my ability to solve real-world e-commerce problems using structured queries. From improving customer retention to optimizing inventory, the project provides valuable insights into operational challenges and solutions.

By completing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how SQL can tackle complex data problems and drive business decision-making.
